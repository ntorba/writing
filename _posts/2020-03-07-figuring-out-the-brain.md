# Intro 
Mathew Cobb recently wrote [Why your brain is not a computer](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/27/why-your-brain-is-not-a-computer-neuroscience-neural-networks-consciousness) on The Guardian. Thank you to [Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/) and [Data Exlixir](https://dataelixir.com/) newsletters for sending both sending this to me. 

# Summary
In this article, Cobb details some of history of the "brain as a computer metaphor." With the rise of AI, this topic has become very relevant. There are many smart people in many different camps, and its hard to figure out who has the best information when there is so much out there. 

# My Thoughts
While reading this, an idea from a software engineering article I recently read struck me: "It is easier to write code than to read it." The consequences of this fact are littered throughout code bases and can help us understand our struggle to understand the brain. 

Reading code is a form of reverse engineering. Working in the reverse direction is often much more difficult than building from the ground up. This is counter-intuitive until you experience it. Very commonly in software, problems that seem quicky and easy end up thorny and difficult. 

Example: Replace above paragraph with this: 
It was a sunny day and I was bored - that's how most of my troubles begin. 

So, a motivated engineer sees a big jumble of old code for an "easy" problem and decides this other person must have been an idiot, so they decide to take their own stab at it, only to find that their new solution is a new fangled mess as well.

This situaiton is prominent in other work as well. Many tasks are forms of reverse engineering - reading even! 
Replace above: reverse engineering is for nincompoops, you should be much better than that. 
It is easier to write and understand your own thoughts than to read and understand someone else's. So, if we humans find reverse engineering so difficult for these everyday tasks, its not wonder its been such a nightmare trying to reverse engineer the brain. It is no wonder our main metaphor for the brain is computers. We built computers and use them everyday. They are the closest analogue we have, although they are quite different.

This line of thought puts me firmly in the "better metaphor for understanding" category. The only chance humans have to understand the brain is to continue to try to build our own version then compare the outcome. 

If we were given a modern computer 100 years ago, would it have advanced the rate of technology? I suppose not. It would have been so advanced that the people of the times wouldn't have known where to start reverse engineering such a complex technology. So it is with the brain. It has somehow put itself far ahead of our time, out of reach of reverse engineering, a skill we so desperately wish we were proficient at for this task. 

New conclusion:
no way we are going to have AGI any time soon - hot take

# Intro 
Mathew Cobb recently wrote (Why your brain is not a computer)[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/27/why-your-brain-is-not-a-computer-neuroscience-neural-networks-consciousness] on The Guardian. Thank you to [Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/) and [Data Exlixir](https://dataelixir.com/) newsletters for sending both sending this to me. 

## Summary
In this article, Cobb details some of history of the "brain as a computer metaphor." With the rise of AI, this topic has become very relevant. There are many smart people in many different camps, and its hard to figure out who has the best information when there is so much out there. 

## My Thoughts
Recently, I came across an article that introduced me to an obvious truth of software engineering: (I need to link to the article) "It is easier to write code than to read it." The consequences of this fact are littered throughout code bases across the web. This is especially prominent in collaborative projects. When a single person sits down to work, with a specific goal, some of the code to perform that task they need is likely already in the code base, but if they didn't write it, they likely don't know it is there. And because of the high effort it would take to read and understand all the existing code, they build their new solution from scratch, adding new code that is similar to pre-existing functionality that already exists. As this happens more times through the lifecyle of a project, you can get congested code bases. 
This situaiton is prominent in other work as well. It is easier to write and understand your own thoughts than to read and understand someone else's. That is why the reverse engineering the brain is such an insurmountable task. If we struggle so much with simply understanding other people's code or work, it seems near impossible to understand what can be described as an alien technology that rules our lives everyday. 
So, this thought puts me firmly into the category of us better understanding the brain through the creation of new technology, giving us a better metaphor for understanding. It seems much more likely that we can coem to an understanding in this way, because the best way for humans to understand anything is to do it themselves. The brain is just too complex to really take apart and put back togehter like a computer. But, even if people were given a modern computer without any previou knowledge of the technology, would they really be able to reverse engineer it? And our brains are much more complex than that.

Depth over breadth was introduced to me while listening to [The Art of Learning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140230386/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?imprToken=8S8HjpFN5qUYGel0nDft0A&slotNum=1&ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0140230386&linkCode=w61&tag=farnamstreet-20) by Josh Waitzkin. 
The main idea is that you can gain a much better understanding of the bigger picture (any object or field of study) by digging deep on a seemingly small part. For example, as a software engineer, depth over breadth is dedicating your time to a single programming language instead of trying to learn 3 at once. A deep understanding of a single language improves your general programming ability more than a shallow understanding of many. Not to mention, learning new languages after a deep understanding of one opens the door to many important, nuanced connections. 

Digging into the small part is what Josh calls the micro. "Depth over breadth" is understanding the macro (programming in general) from the micro (a single programming language). 

A great example Josh uses in the book is from [The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060839872/ref=sr_1_2?crid=5B53JPNMK4KC&dchild=1&keywords=the+art+of+motorcycle+maintenance&qid=1595588821&s=books&sprefix=The+art+of+motor%2Cstripbooks%2C142&sr=1-2). The main character, Phadreus, is a professor at a college in Bozeman, Montana. He teaches literature and writing. At one point, a notably hard working student is stumped with writerâ€™s block. The assignment is to write 500 words about Bozeman, a small town in rural Montana. Despite her determination, she just can't get any words on the page. After many attempts to help, Phradreus frustratedly tells her "Narrow it down to the front of one building on the main street of Bozeman. The Opera House. Start with the upper left-hand brick." The next day, the girl turns in a 5000 word essay. Starting with a single brick, she receives endless inspiration. Starting with something so small (the micro) gave her an entirely new view of the whole town (the macro).

This idea takes our original software analogy even further. Forget focusing on an entire language. Focus on a single library. Tear it apart. Use the debugger and step through all levels of the code. Look at how the authors abstracted their ideas. Analyze the data structures. Look for the use of language specific features. Contribute to it.

Deep understanding of a single library does much more than just help you understand that library. As you use others, you begin to see important connections, or striking differences. Those connections help you pick up new libraries much faster. You also begin to build a much deeper understanding of the language itself.  

With a strategy like this, you build a deeper understanding of the macro (a programming language, or even programming itself) by narrowing in on the micro (a specific library of a single language).

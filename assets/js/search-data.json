            "content": "Good at Math, Bad at Writing . The biggest failure of my education was the acceptance of the “good at math, bad at writing” label. It comes as no surprise that I ended up working as a software engineer, but it took until now to see how much time I wasted hating writing, when in fact, the underlying principles are strikingly similar. . Looking at the end product, the similarities are hard to see. Books and programs are much different, but the process to generate them is quite similar. For both, the ultimate goal is to give the user/reader (“user” for software and “reader” for writing - they serve the same purpose) a particular experience by providing information in a well thought out structure. This goal is achieved using a set of tools and conventions. Software leverages programming languages with different designs (object oriented vs functional, for example) and frameworks (web application vs data application). Writing leverages spoken language with accepted structures such as short-stories, books, long-form, and poems. In both, deciding the general structure and design (picking a programming language vs picking a writing structure) is integral to creating the end experience you wish to generate. . Software engineers specialize in particular niches similar to authors specializing in particular structures. I build data applications with python to improve the experience of data scientists while poets use poems to create an experience for their readers. In the end, the best software engineers and writers are those who most effectively organize and present necessary information to their audience. . It is sometimes easy to miss when this is done well, but never hard to miss when done poorly. Everyone knows the absolute frustration of using software that is particularly difficult to understand or flat out doesn’t do what its supposed to. While bad writing leaves you lost, or worse, leaves you in apparent understanding, only later finding you completely missed the point the author wanted to get across (something I’ve had happen in my writing many a time). Both of these are results of bad information organization. At some point the creators mis executed along their path to creating the experience they planned on. . Most disciplines share the same underlying principles. These hidden connections is what makes me so sad about the all too common “Good at math, bad at writing” label given to so many students at such a young age. It is harmful to plant this idea in a young mind, blocking them from the hidden connections they then don’t bother to look for. I’ve come to realize how important and enjoyable writing is in my everyday life. Not only do you need to write more than ever to communicate with work colleagues via slack and email, but nothing can help boost memory more than writing well thought out notes about new topics and ideas. . I’m angry at any teacher who allowed this idea to propagate or ever did a shitty job teaching an English class. English teachers have such a great opportunity to showcase how important writing is to every aspect of life and they squandered it. . This realization has been very important to me. I will forever despise the “good at math, bad at writing” because of the limitations it tricks people into thinking they have. .",

            "title": "Exploring Metaflow",
            "content": "About . metaflow is a python package open sourced by netflix to help data scientists easily scale their project workflows. Metaflow is mainly interacted with through decorators. In this post, we will get behind the scenes of how these decorators actually work. . The code . To start, let&#39;s take a look at the first example in the documentation. This is a simple flow. . from metaflow import FlowSpec, step class LinearFlow(FlowSpec): @step def start(self): self.my_var = &#39;hello world&#39; self.next(self.a) @step def a(self): print(&#39;the data artifact is: %s&#39; % self.my_var) self.next(self.end) @step def end(self): print(&#39;the data artifact is still: %s&#39; % self.my_var) LinearFlow() . We see that the LinearFlow python class inherits from metaflow&#39;s FlowSpec class, and each of the functions are decorated with @step. As seen (here)[https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics], this basic flow follows metaflow&#39;s guidelines. However, what is actually happening? How does it turn our functions into pipeline steps? Let&#39;s start by taking a look at the Flowspec class. . (Flowspec)[https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/blob/master/metaflow/flowspec.py] definition and constructor. Full code can be found at the link. . class FlowSpec(object): &quot;&quot;&quot; Main class from which all Flows should inherit.

            "title": "Figuring Out The Brain",
            "content": "Intro . Mathew Cobb recently wrote (Why your brain is not a computer)[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/27/why-your-brain-is-not-a-computer-neuroscience-neural-networks-consciousness] on The Guardian. Thank you to Data Science Weekly and Data Exlixir newsletters for sending both sending this to me. . Summary . In this article, Cobb details some of history of the “brain as a computer metaphor.” With the rise of AI, this topic has become very relevant. There are many smart people in many different camps, and its hard to figure out who has the best information when there is so much out there. . My Thoughts . Recently, I came across an article that introduced me to an obvious truth of software engineering: (I need to link to the article) “It is easier to write code than to read it.” The consequences of this fact are littered throughout code bases across the web. This is especially prominent in collaborative projects. When a single person sits down to work, with a specific goal, some of the code to perform that task they need is likely already in the code base, but if they didn’t write it, they likely don’t know it is there. And because of the high effort it would take to read and understand all the existing code, they build their new solution from scratch, adding new code that is similar to pre-existing functionality that already exists. As this happens more times through the lifecyle of a project, you can get congested code bases. This situaiton is prominent in other work as well. It is easier to write and understand your own thoughts than to read and understand someone else’s. That is why the reverse engineering the brain is such an insurmountable task. If we struggle so much with simply understanding other people’s code or work, it seems near impossible to understand what can be described as an alien technology that rules our lives everyday. So, this thought puts me firmly into the category of us better understanding the brain through the creation of new technology, giving us a better metaphor for understanding. It seems much more likely that we can coem to an understanding in this way, because the best way for humans to understand anything is to do it themselves. The brain is just too complex to really take apart and put back togehter like a computer. But, even if people were given a modern computer without any previou knowledge of the technology, would they really be able to reverse engineer it? And our brains are much more complex than that. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . Front Matter is a markdown cell at the beginning of your notebook that allows you to inject metadata into your notebook. For example: . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown.

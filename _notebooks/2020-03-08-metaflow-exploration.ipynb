    "[metaflow](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow) is a python package open sourced by netflix to help data scientists easily scale their project workflows. Metaflow is mainly interacted with through decorators. In this post, we will get behind the scenes of how these decorators actually work. "

As seen (here)[https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics], this basic flow follows metaflow's guidelines. However, what is actually happening? How does it turn our functions into pipeline steps? Let's start by taking a look at the Flowspec class."

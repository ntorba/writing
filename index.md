Welcome to __Writing Partnership Central__. This site will be a conglomeration of the work produced through various writing partnerships. Starting with my (Nick Torba) partnership with Jeremy Tuttle. 

The "Rules" of a Writing Partnership: 
1. Determine a regular cadence of when a writing should be sent to your writing partner. Follow it strictly. "I'm not done" is not an acceptable excuse. Send what you have. 
2. When revising, do not hold back. Do not be afraid to hurt the other person's feelings.
3. Make rule number 2 easy by coming from a position of honesty, curiousity, and inquisition while editing
4. Write about anything you want 

The goals of a Writing Partnership are:
1. Create external obligation to actually write at some regular cadence
2. Improve writing and thinking skills by giving and receiving thoughtful critism
3. Stay connected with friends

You can edit the `index.md` file to change this content.
